To try this personal project out, download this tool called XAMPP(https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). Make sure that you have php installed first though. Follow through the setup, and then launch this app named XAMPP Control Panel after the installation. There are five services to start in the control panel. Startup Apache and MySQL. Click on the Config button for Apache, and go to httpd.conf. Look for a section labeled DocumentRoot, the path listed as the DocumentRoot is where you put the repostiory folder in.
